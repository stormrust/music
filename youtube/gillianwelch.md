#### I dream a Highway

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love   
A winding ribbon with a band of gold   
A silver vision, come and rest my soul   
I dream a highway back to you  

John, he's kicking out the footlights   
The Grand Ole Opry's got a brand new band   
Lord, let me die with a hammer in my hand   
I dream a highway back to you  

I think I'll move down into Memphis   
And thank the hatchet man who forked my tongue   
I lie and wait until the wagons come   
And dream a highway back to you   

The getaway kickin' up cinders   
An empty wagon full of rattling bones   
Moon in the mirror on a three hour Jones   
I dream a highway back to you   

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love   
A winding ribbon with a band of gold   
A silver vision, come arrest my soul   
I dream a highway back to you   

Which lover are you, Jack of Diamonds?   
Now you be Emmylou and I'll be Gram   
I send a letter, don't know who I am   
I dream a highway back to you   

I'm an indisguisable shade of twilight   
Any second now, I'm gonna turn myself on   
In the blue display of the cool cathode ray   
I dream a highway back to you   

I wish you knew me, Jack of Diamonds   
Fire riding, wheeling when I lead 'em up   
Drank whiskey with my water, sugar in my tea  
My sails in rags with the staggers and the jags  
I dream a highway back to you  

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love  
A winding ribbon with a band of gold   
A silver vision, come molest my soul  
I dream a highway back to you  

Now, give me some of what you're having  
I'll take you as a viper into my head  
A knife into my bed, arsenic when I'm fed  
I dream a highway back to you  

Hang overhead from all directions  
Radiation from the porcelain light  
Blind and blistered by the morning white  
I dream a highway back to you  

Sunday morning at the Diner  
Hollywood trembles on the verge of tears  
I watched the waitress for a thousand years  
Saw a wheel inside a wheel, heard a call within a call  
I dreamed a highway back to, you  

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love  
A winding ribbon with a band of gold  
A silver vision, come molest my soul  
I dream a highway back to you  

Step into the light, poor Lazarus  
Don't lie alone behind the window shade  
Let me see the mark death made  
I dream a highway back to you  

I dream a highway back to you  
What will sustain us through the winter?  
Where did last years lessons go?  
Walk me out into the rain and snow  
I dream a highway back to you  

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love  
A winding ribbon with a band of gold  
A silver vision, come and bless my soul  
I dream a highway back to you  

I dream a highway back to you  
Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love  
A winding ribbon with a band of gold  
A silver vision, come and bless my soul  
I dream a highway back to you
