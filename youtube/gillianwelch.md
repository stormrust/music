#### I dream a Highway

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love   
A winding ribbon with a band of gold   
A silver vision, come and rest my soul   
I dream a highway back to you  

John, he's kicking out the footlights   
The Grand Ole Opry's got a brand new band   
Lord, let me die with a hammer in my hand   
I dream a highway back to you  

I think I'll move down into Memphis   
And thank the hatchet man who forked my tongue   
I lie and wait until the wagons come   
And dream a highway back to you   

The getaway kickin' up cinders   
An empty wagon full of rattling bones   
Moon in the mirror on a three hour Jones   
I dream a highway back to you   

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love   
A winding ribbon with a band of gold   
A silver vision, come arrest my soul   
I dream a highway back to you   

Which lover are you, Jack of Diamonds?   
Now you be Emmylou and I'll be Gram   
I send a letter, don't know who I am   
I dream a highway back to you   

I'm an indisguisable shade of twilight   
Any second now, I'm gonna turn myself on   
In the blue display of the cool cathode ray   
I dream a highway back to you   

I wish you knew me, Jack of Diamonds   
Fire riding, wheeling when I lead 'em up   
Drank whiskey with my water, sugar in my tea  
My sails in rags with the staggers and the jags  
I dream a highway back to you  

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love  
A winding ribbon with a band of gold   
A silver vision, come molest my soul  
I dream a highway back to you  

Now, give me some of what you're having  
I'll take you as a viper into my head  
A knife into my bed, arsenic when I'm fed  
I dream a highway back to you  

Hang overhead from all directions  
Radiation from the porcelain light  
Blind and blistered by the morning white  
I dream a highway back to you  

Sunday morning at the Diner  
Hollywood trembles on the verge of tears  
I watched the waitress for a thousand years  
Saw a wheel inside a wheel, heard a call within a call  
I dreamed a highway back to, you  

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love  
A winding ribbon with a band of gold  
A silver vision, come molest my soul  
I dream a highway back to you  

Step into the light, poor Lazarus  
Don't lie alone behind the window shade  
Let me see the mark death made  
I dream a highway back to you  

I dream a highway back to you  
What will sustain us through the winter?  
Where did last years lessons go?  
Walk me out into the rain and snow  
I dream a highway back to you  

Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love  
A winding ribbon with a band of gold  
A silver vision, come and bless my soul  
I dream a highway back to you  

I dream a highway back to you  
Oh, I dream a highway back to you, love  
A winding ribbon with a band of gold  
A silver vision, come and bless my soul  
I dream a highway back to you

#### Method Acting / Cortez The Killer

There's no beginning to the story  
A bookshelf sinks into the sand  
And a language learned, forgot in turn  
Studied once again  
It's a shocking bit of footage  
Viewed on a shitty TV screen  
You can squint at it  
The snow and static  
To make out what it means  
And keep stretching that antenna  
Hoping that it will come clear  
I need some reception  
A higher message  
Please tell me what to feel  
Cause I don't know what tomorrow brings  
It's alive with such possibilities  
But I know that I feel better when I sing  
Burdens are lifted from me  
That's my voice rising


So T-Bone, please keep the tape rolling  
Gil, keep strumming that guitar  
We need a record of our failures  
We must document our love  
I sat too long in my silence  
Grown too old on my pain  
To shed this skin, be born again  
It starts with an ending  
And I don't know what tomorrow brings  
It's full of such possibilities  
But I know that I feel better when I sing  
Burdens are lifted from me  
That's my voice rising  


It's not a movie, no private screening  
This method acting, I call it living  
It's like a fountain, the door is open  
We have a problem with no solution  
But to love and to be loved  


So thank you friends for the time we've shared  
Your love stays with me like sunlight and air  
And though I truly wish I could keep hanging around here  
My joy is covering me, soon I will disappear  


He came dancing across the water  
With his galleons and guns  
Looking for the new world  
In the palace in the sun  
On the shore lay Montezuma  
With his coca leaves and pearls  
In his halls, he often wondered  
The secrets of the world  
And his subjects gathered round him  
Like the leaves around a tree  
In their clothes of many colors  
For the angry gods to see  
And the women all looked beautiful  
And the men stood straight and strong  
They offered life in sacrifice  
So that others could go on  


Hate was just a legend  
And war was never known  
The people worked together  
And they lifted many stones  
Then they carried them to the flatlands  
But they died along the way  
And they built up with their bare hands  
What we still can't do today  
And I know she's living there  
And she loves me to this day  
I just can't remember when  
Or how I lost my way
